Performed a comprehensive data analysis and visualization using Microsoft Excel. I began by duplicating the original dataset to create a working sheet, ensuring the raw data remained intact. I then carried out data cleaning by removing duplicates, standardizing inconsistent entries, and formatting data types for accuracy. Using PivotTables and charts, I developed a clear visualization dashboard that illustrates the average income performance across gender and marital status groups. The dashboard provides insights into income trends between married and single males and females.
