## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis workflow using **Microsoft Excel**. The objective was to transform a raw dataset of 1,026 records of potential bike buyers into a clean, structured format to identify key demographic trends influencing income and purchasing behavior.

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning Process
To ensure the integrity of the analysis, I followed a rigorous cleaning phase:
1. **Data Preservation:** Duplicated the original dataset into a "Working Sheet" to keep the raw data intact.
2. **Duplicate Removal:** Identified and removed redundant entries to ensure a unique count of 1,000 accurate rows.
3. **Standardization:** Fixed inconsistencies in categorical columns (e.g., standardizing "M" to "Married" and "S" to "Single").
4. **Data Type Formatting:** Adjusted currency and numerical fields to ensure proper calculation in PivotTables.
